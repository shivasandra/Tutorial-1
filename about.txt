Analysis & Commentary on Regression Results
1. Residual Standard Error (RSE): 2.15

-The RSE represents the average deviation of actual sales from the predicted values.
-A value of 2.15 means that, on average, the model's predictions deviate by approximately 2.15 sales units.
-A lower RSE would indicate a better model fit, suggesting that there may be some unexplained variability in sales.

2. R² (R-squared): 0.547

-This means 54.7% of the variation in Sales can be explained by the advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper).
-While this is a moderate correlation, it indicates that there are other factors affecting sales that are not captured in this model.
-A higher R² (closer to 1) would indicate a stronger model fit.

3. F-statistic: 6.43

-The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model.
-A value of 6.43 suggests that at least one of the predictor variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper) has a significant effect on sales.
-If the p-value associated with the F-statistic is small (typically < 0.05), it confirms that the model as a whole is meaningful.

Insights:
-TV & Radio likely contribute significantly to sales based on prior marketing studies.
-Newspaper advertising might have a weaker effect, and we should check its p-value and coefficients for statistical significance.
-The moderate R² suggests that additional factors (e.g., digital marketing, seasonality, competitor activities) might influence sales.
